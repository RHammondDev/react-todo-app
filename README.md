Project Title: react-todo-app

Project Description:  In this app, you can add, delete, submit and edit items. To edit items, simply double click on it. Once you are done, press the enter key to resubmit. This app will persist your data in the browser local storage. So whether you reload, close your app or reopened it, you still have access to your to-dos items.

This Todo App was developed based upon Ibas Majid's tutorial @ https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/

This Tutorial was using deprecated React Router 5 code and so I went ahead and refactored the routing code so that it works properly with the current React Router 6 library.

Adjusted some of the CSS to my liking.
