Project Title: react-todo-app

Project Description:  

    This Todo App was developed based upon Ibas Majid's tutorial @ https://ibaslogic.com/react-tutorial-for-beginners/

    In this application you can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on Todo list items. You can also edit items in the todo list by double-clicking on them and then press enter when you are finished. This application takes advantage of your browsers localStorage to persist the data in the todo list. 

    This Tutorial was using deprecated React Router 5 code and so I went ahead and refactored the routing code so that it works properly with the current React Router 6 library.

    Also adjusted a tiny bit of CSS.

Download/Clone: git clone https://github.com/RHammondDev/react-todo-app.git

Installation: Change Directory to the folder of the react-todo-app and then in the terminal/console use the "npm install" commmand.

Start the Application: Type "npm start" in the terminal/console and then visit localhost:3000 in your browser if it does not launch automatically.

Thanks again to https://github.com/Ibaslogic for creating the tutorial.
